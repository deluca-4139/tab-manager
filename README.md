# たっぶり

This is a work-in-progress Firefox extension for managing tabs. Its final form and functionality are not yet decided on, but it will hopefully be able to

* sort tabs based on domain/search criteria
* save and open individual browsing sessions
* store tab, window, and browsing info locally
* identify similar and duplicate tabs
* organize tab usage by unique windows that can be switched between
* provide easy to use interfaces for sorting, deleting, and reorganizing tabs

## Background

The extension's name is a play on the word たっぷり (*tappuri*) from Japanese, which means "in ample supply". Because my tabs are always in ample supply, no matter what browser I happen to be using, I thought this was an apt name for an extension to help manage them.
